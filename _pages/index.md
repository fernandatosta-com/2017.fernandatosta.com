I love to do things with my own hands, I love to search and finally discover what I was looking for. I love challenges, doing something I never did before, it´s a kind of Beta way of life for me. Finding problems to fix, and making great mistakes to reach great solutions.

I believe communication is the key and I´m working on it. If you think you’re not good enough, I´m with you. We can talk, discuss, disagree. We can come to consensus or not, but we can do it respecting each other with nonviolent communication. I believe we can (ex)change ideas or build new ones from a new perspective.

I love to learn, and teach people with different backgrounds, ages and in different stages in life. I am committed to find forms/resources to teach concepts in different ways, according to who is listening, and to share knowledge with those who want to learn, or those who have difficulties to understand, or are in any way disadvantaged.

I invite you to come and take a look anyway, take your time or come back later. Get in touch and say what you want to say. I like most people that are not afraid to show their feelings, so please don’t be shy or too formal.
